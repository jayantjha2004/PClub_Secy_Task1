Bob and Alice are playing a game. You may have played it in childhood with your friends :)

They have been given a positive integer $n$ called the "danger number". Bob starts the game and speaks a number between $1$ to $3$. Alice has to add the number Bob just spoke with $1$, $2$, or $3$ and speak that number aloud. And Bob does the same with the number Alice spoke, and the game goes on.

The first person who is forced to speak a number \textbf{greater than or equal to $n$} loses the game. A sample game could go on as follows:

\textit{Suppose $n=9$. Bob speaks $2$ in his first turn. Alice speaks $5$ in her turn, adding $3$ to the number. Bob again speaks $8$ by adding $3$ to the number. Now, Alice is forced to speak a number greater than or equal to $9$, and thus loses the game, and Bob wins.}

You have been given the danger number, $n$. Your job is to find out if both players play optimally, who would win the game for that specific $n$.

Note that in the above example, the players did not play optimally. The purpose of the example was just to demonstrate how the game works.
